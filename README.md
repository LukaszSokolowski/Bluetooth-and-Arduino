This simple code flash a LED on 13 pin using Bluetooth module.
To connect with Bluetooth module with iOS device you must use an app from appstore called "LightBlue".
After uploading this code to Arduino platform this application should find your bluetooth module.
You can use three commands: on off and flash as you can see in arduino code.
These commands you must type in application which I mention above.
